I've heard about this video going around, and [No Impact Man](http://noimpactman.typepad.com) points out that we are  [Forced to face the big questions](http://noimpactman.typepad.com/blog/2008/03/forced-to-face.html).

His only mistake is saying "Don't watch it if you are queasy".  _If you eat meat you **must** watch it_.  You must be able to look at all parts of the production of your food and be prepared to not only watch but to participate.  If you are not willing to hold that captive bolt gun and watch it slam into a cow's head, if you are not willing to gut that chicken, if you are not willing to cut up that corpse, then you are a coward and a hypocrite.  The vast majority of people in the developed world are happy to let others engage in this horrible, brutal (and dangerous) work so that they can pick up their meat, neatly wrapped in plastic, from their grocery store, and remain blissfully and willfully ignorant of the full reality of what goes on.

Speaking for myself, I grew up on a farm, I've worked in the fields and harvested the fruits and vegetables.  I would be happy to do that for any of the food in my kitchen.  I am a member of a [CSA](http://www.helsingfarmcsa.com), I have visited the farm and I wouldn't mind working in the fields.  Can you say the same about what is in your kitchen?  If not, maybe you should reconsider what you eat.
