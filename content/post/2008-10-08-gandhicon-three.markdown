Are we at [Gandhicon](http://catb.org/jargon/html/G/GandhiCon.html) three yet?   We now have two cases of anti-bike people demanding environmental reviews of facilities for bicyclists, one in [San Francisco](http://www.streetsblog.org/2008/08/26/budnick-v-anderson-on-talk-of-the-nation-this-afternoon/) and one in [New York City](http://www.streetsblog.org/2008/10/02/foes-of-car-free-trial-in-prospect-park-demand-environmental-review/).  (of course the supreme irony is that these people probably would have fought environmental reviews for car-oriented facilities).  Whatever, I'm looking forward to Gandhicon four.
