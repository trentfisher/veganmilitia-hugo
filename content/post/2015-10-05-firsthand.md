On a certain genealogy site I found this listed under sources:

     Wilfred ***, firsthand knowledge. ...  Entered by Wilfred ***, Jun 21, 2012

Considering the page is about someone who lived in the mid 18th century, it seems unlikely Wilfred has actual "firsthand knowledge"; not unless he's invented a time machine!  I think lawyers would call this "hearsay" and judges would call it inadmissible.
