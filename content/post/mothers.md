Every time I visit my mother, we end up doing a bunch of genealogy work, and then afterwards I continue doing a bunch of research, and our latest visit was no exception.
Several months ago I posted 
[lamenting the lack of information about mothers in family trees]
(2015-04-03-retroactive-matriarchy.markdown).
After visiting with my mother, I started looking at all the mothers in the family tree, and started doing some searches on each and I turned up a number of books written about the families to which these women belonged.

For example, I found that my great-grandmother [Eva Cummings]
(http://www.werelate.org/wiki/Person:Eva_Cummings_%283%29),
was part of [a long line of Cummings]
(http://www.werelate.org/wiki/Source:Mooar%2C_George._Cummings_Memorial_:_A_Genealogical_History_of_the_Descendants_of_Isaac_Cummings%2C_an_Early_Settler_of_Topsfield%2C_Massachusetts), including a [Revolutionary War veteran](http://www.werelate.org/wiki/Person:Ebenezer_Cummings_%286%29)
and leading back to [John Cummings](http://www.werelate.org/wiki/Person:John_Cummings_%2816%29) who came to America in 1635.

Eva's mother, [Naomi Olcott](http://www.werelate.org/wiki/Person:Naomi_Olcott_%281%29), led me to the [Olcott family](http://www.werelate.org/wiki/Source:Goodwin%2C_Nathaniel._Descendants_of_Thomas_Olcott%2C_One_of_the_First_Settlers_of_Hartford%2C_Ct) which may connect her to one of the founders of Hartford, Connecticut in 1635 (more research needed to find out if that connection can be made).

Naomi's mother led me to the Holbrook family, which leads back to
[Thomas Holbrook](http://www.werelate.org/wiki/Person:Thomas_Holbrook_%284%29)
who came to America in 1635 (more research to be done).

my second great grandmother (via my mother's mother), [Abigail Abbot Harrington](http://www.werelate.org/wiki/Person:Abrigail_Harrington_%281%29)
led me to the [Harrington Family](http://www.werelate.org/wiki/Source:Harrington%2C_George_H._Manuscript_of_Harrington_Family_Genealogical_Gazetteer)
and to a [Revolutionary War veteran](http://www.werelate.org/wiki/Person:Jason_Harrington_%282%29) and, eventually, to
[Robert Harrington](http://www.werelate.org/wiki/Person:Robert_Harrington_%283%29) who came to America in 1635.

Abigail's mother, [Isabanda Cole](http://www.werelate.org/wiki/Person:Isabanda_Cole_%281%29) led me to [a book about the Cole family](http://www.werelate.org/wiki/Source:Cole%2C_Frank_T._Early_Genealogies_of_the_Cole_Families_in_America).  I have yet to investigate that branch, but it seems to lead to another of the founders of Hartford, CT.

My Second great grandmother, [Sarah Crose](http://www.werelate.org/wiki/Person:Sarah_Crose_%2811%29)
(who I mentioned in my earlier post),
led me to another [Revolutionary War veteran](http://www.werelate.org/wiki/Person:Philip_Crose_%281%29)

Sarah's mother-in-law,
[Elizabeth Gorton]
(http://www.werelate.org/wiki/Person:Elizabeth_Gorton_%2816%29)
led me into the [Gorton family]
(http://www.werelate.org/wiki/Source:Gorton%2C_Adelos._Life_and_Times_of_Samuel_Gorton)
where I found another [Revolutionary War veteran]
(http://www.werelate.org/wiki/Person:Samuel_Gorton_%2840%29)
and back to [Samuel Gorton]
(http://www.werelate.org/wiki/Person:Samuel_Gorton_%281%29)
who was the founder of Warwick, Rhode Island, and, in 1652, the author of 
an act calling for the abolition of slavery, which was enacted, but, sadly, largely ignored.

I still need to research some mothers with the names "Wolf", "Crouch", "Grant", "Hoffman", "Gates", and "Cheney".  But the last two have me worried.

I guess the main lesson here is "listen to your mother!"
