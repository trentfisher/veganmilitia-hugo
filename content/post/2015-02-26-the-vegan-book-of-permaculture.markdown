Reposted from [my BlurBlog](http://ift.tt/1vnmZ8P): **The Vegan Book of Permaculture**  

By Meghan  
  



Graham Burnett has published a new book called the [Vegan Book of Permaculture](http://ift.tt/1AtOv6Z). This book combines ethical vegan recipes with permaculture principles for ecological living and gardening.

_"Long time permaculture practitioner and activist Graham Burnett has written a very practical guide to living lightly using permaculture design within the ethical constraints and opportunities of a vegan diet. Based on lived experience rather than ideology, the strong focus on food, complete with recipes, helps vegans and omnivores alike make better use of the diversity of plant based ingredients in cool temperate climates. For vegans wanting to reduce their ecological footprint, maintain nutritional balance and increase their autonomy and resilience in a rapidly changing world, this book is the ideal introduction to permaculture living and land use."_

_- David Holmgren, Co-originator of the Permaculture concept_

[More information and reviews](http://ift.tt/1AtOv6Z) are available on Graham's website.

Graham is also the author of numerous other publications, including [Permaculture: A Beginner's Guide](http://ift.tt/1AtOv70), which is available in French, Spanish and Croatian.

  
  

It's great to see a book combining these two important ideas.
