[![](http://veganmilitia.org/b/wp-content/uploads/2008/11/dscn0984-300x224.jpg)](http://veganmilitia.org/b/wp-content/uploads/2008/11/dscn0984.jpg)As we labor up the hill on 106th Ave NE, towards 4th street we are presented with this odd situation:  for no readily apparent reason, the bike lane briefly shrinks to about 1 foot wide, and then back again.  I suddenly remember yoga class.  Inhale!  Hold!  Exhale!
