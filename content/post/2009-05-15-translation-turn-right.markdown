[![](http://veganmilitia.org/b/wp-content/uploads/2008/11/dscn0986-300x224.jpg)](http://veganmilitia.org/b/wp-content/uploads/2008/11/dscn0986.jpg)Our oh so brief sojourn down 106th Ave comes to an abrupt end at 4th Street.  Of course it isn't enough to simply bring the bike lane to an end, but to re-assert the God-given supremacy of the automobile.  Rather than just paint the line straight to the crosswalk, they swerve the line over, squeezing cyclists and making it rather hard to continue up 106th Ave.  The implication is that you should instead, turn right... though watch out for the Hummer taking advantage of those extra couple of inches to accommodate their bulk as they proceed around the corner.
