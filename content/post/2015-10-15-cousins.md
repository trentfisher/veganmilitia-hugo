So it all started when I found a great grandmother with the last name "Cheney".  That got me scared.  So I tracked down that part of my family tree and found that she, ultimately, descended from 
[John Cheney of Newbury](http://www.werelate.org/wiki/Person:John_Cheney_%2846%29)
but [Dick Cheney](http://www.werelate.org/wiki/Person:Richard_Cheney_%288%29) descended from [William Cheney of Roxbury](http://www.werelate.org/wiki/Person:William_Cheney_%281%29).
There are theories that these two ancestors were related, possibly brothers, but no evidence has been found either way.  So I could maintain some plausible deniability that Dick Cheney and I are not 9th cousins 1 time removed.  Whew!

But then I found a connection to the Holbrook family, which, ultimately led back to [Thomas Holbrook](http://www.werelate.org/wiki/Person:Thomas_Holbrook_%283%29).  A note on his page mentioned some U.S. Presidents.  I found that [James Garfield](http://www.werelate.org/wiki/Person:James_Garfield_%281%29) is my 6th cousin 3 times removed, [William Taft](http://www.werelate.org/wiki/Person:William_Taft_%282%29) is my 5th cousin 3 times removed, and, [George W. Bush](http://www.werelate.org/wiki/Person:George_Bush_%283%29) is my 8th cousin 1 time removed.  It is a cruel twist that all of these Presidents were Republicans, though at least two of them had qualifications to actually do the job.

The closest I've come to a Democratic president is [Ulysses Grant](http://www.werelate.org/wiki/Person:Hiram_Grant_%282%29), but, as near as I can figure out, my connection to that family is via [an illegitimate child who was brought up as a Grant](http://www.werelate.org/wiki/Person:Beriah_Grant_%281%29).

But, in the end, I'm glad that nobody can prove I'm related to Dick Cheney.
