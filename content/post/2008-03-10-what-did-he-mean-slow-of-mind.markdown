Now that I have completed my 41st orbit around the sun, I figured it was about time I got my act together and got a blog going.  I have been waffling between wikis and blogs for some time.  This site was a blog about 4 years ago, and recently I've been messing with wikis.  Neither of them is the ideal solution for collecting and organizing the various ideas and things a person runs across.  It seems to me that the wiki doesn't work so well for random little thoughts and such, but the blog doesn't do much for helping organize things.  But, it's been years since I last tried blogging, so we'll see.

Anyway, this blog is simply a way to sort out and store my thoughts on subjects that interest me.  Who knows, there's a small chance there may be other people who think like me out there.
