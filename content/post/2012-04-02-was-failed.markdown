The new installer for ClearCase is a mess in many ways, but this error made me cringe:

    
    System kernel was failed to build properly and as a result MVFS was not loaded.


The bad grammar and missing punctuation are just a little extra insult to the injury of not being told HOW the kernel build failed, or, perhaps better yet, what to do about it.
