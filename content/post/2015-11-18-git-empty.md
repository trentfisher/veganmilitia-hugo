I ran into a situation today, which was quite astonishing: Git creates new repositories in an inconsistent state.  Until the first checkin is done, the repository has HEAD pointing to a nonexistent location.  I discovered this because I was replicating several other team's Git servers for backup purposes.  In experimenting with this I came up with this reproduction:

    $ git init --bare foo.git
    Initialized empty Git repository in /tmp/foo.git/
    $ git clone --bare foo.git foo2.git
    Cloning into bare repository 'foo2.git'...
    warning: You appear to have cloned an empty repository.
    $ cd foo2.git
    $ git fetch
    fatal: Couldn't find remote ref HEAD
    fatal: The remote end hung up unexpectedly

While doing clone and fetch from an empty repository is a silly thing to do, but it isn't worthy of a fatal error.  No other systems I work with have this flaw.  So now I have to modify my replication scripts to detect such repositories and avoid them.
