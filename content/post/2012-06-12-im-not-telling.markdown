Is what I get for dutifully installing all updates?

Telling me that the install failed twice is nice, but does not hide the fact that I still don't know why.  I feel like I'm playing a guessing game with my 3 year old daughter:  "I'm not telling!"

I know that if I go to IT they'll want to reimage my machine.  At first their predilection for reimaging bugged me as I thought more effort should go into figuring out the root cause.  But over the years I've come to sympathize with their position.  Usually after hours of probing you run into a brick wall, an OS bug or some silent failure and without source code there's no way around it.  And figuring out a root cause only helps if there's some hope that the problem may be fixed.  So why bother?

Anyway, I've got a Linux CD which could fix the issue once and for all.
