[![Bike lane on 124th Ave NE approaching NE 8th St.](http://veganmilitia.org/b/wp-content/uploads/2008/10/bk2-300x224.jpg)](http://veganmilitia.org/b/wp-content/uploads/2008/10/bk2.jpg)


Since there isn't much traffic on 124th Avenue and it doesn't generally go anywhere useful, Bellevue decided to put a bike lane on it.  That isn't quite fair.   There numerous houses in that neighborhood, so if you live there and are commuting into downtown here's the baffling situation which will greet you as you approach 8th Street.  Rather than do something logical, like put up a sign that says "bike lane ends" and simply stop the lane marker, they chose to instead force cyclists towards the curb, _twice_!  Since the bike lane marker doesn't end properly, car drivers get no indication that they may actually need to expect bicyclists to merge with traffic in order to get to the intersection with 8th St, so they zoom right past blissfully ignorant of your plight.  So really, this bike lane translates to "get off the road", but that title would get monotonous.
