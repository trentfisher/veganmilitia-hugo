One of my favourite blogs was [Suicide Food](http://suicidefood.blogspot.com/). After reading that blog I started noticing more occurrences of this repugnant practice, I started taking pictures and submitted some to the blog. But then the blog stopped. I still have dozens of images I have collected, and I find more every now and then. You can see the raw photos in [my Suicide Food album](https://plus.google.com/photos/109920212061848308238/albums/5555701878508614625). I may post about them every now and then, but don't expect any noose ratings or well-written commentary like the aforementioned blog.

But here's one that comes to mind as being especially egregious. I found this brick in one of my daughter's Duplo sets:

Most of the suicide food images I happen upon are in a grocery store or restaurant where such images are not unexpected. But for it to show up on a toy, a toy which I have loved as long as I can remember, aimed at my daughter was especially bothersome.

What could be more wholesome than a nice glass of milk, offered to you by a smiling, happy cow? "Of course, I'm happy. Parenthood is hard, so the farmer helpfully took away my newborn baby. Now I don't have to deal with the sleepless nights and the endless nursing, what a hassle! The farmer has also helpfully hooked me to this milking machine to prevent my udder from exploding. So have a nice glass, the farmer assures me there isn't too much pus in it."
