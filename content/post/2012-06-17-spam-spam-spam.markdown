The majority of comments I've gotten on this blog have been from spammers.  But fortunately these vile dregs of humanity have managed to amuse me a few times.  Here's a sampling of my favorites:


<blockquote>I love to visit veganmilitia.org every day
hemorrhoids piles</blockquote>


I'm really not sure how to interpret that.  Are the daily visits to my site helping your condition?  Or causing it?


<blockquote>Oh my goodness! a tremendous article dude. Thanks Nonetheless I’m experiencing challenge with ur rss . Don’t know why Unable to subscribe to it. Is there anybody getting equivalent rss drawback? Anyone who is aware of kindly respond. Thnkx</blockquote>


It's hard to imagine a person who would utter both the words "dude" and "goodness", and be incapable of spelling "your".   Perhaps an octogenarian who is into surfing, smoking weed and texting?  As for my RSS feed, I'm running bare vanilla WordPress, if there's a problem with my RSS feed it's more likely to be your problem.  Furthermore, considering my blog posts about vague error messages, anybody who actually reads this blog should know better than to send me a vague, useless error report!


<blockquote>podagra dieta Dna moczanowa dna moczanowa dna moczanowa a ból stawów</blockquote>


Google translate tell me this is Polish for "Diet Gout Gout Gout Gout and arthritis pain". So this person has a variety of maladies, including, it seems, stuttering.  I can suggest a cure for the latter:  keep your mouth shut.


<blockquote>does kefir give you diarrhea... Nothing will ever be attempted, if all possible objections must be first overcome.</blockquote>


Yes, kefir may cause diarrhea, and considering the cruelty involved in getting the milk, it's what you deserve.


<blockquote>homecoming dresses 2012</blockquote>


Yay!   If only I had gotten this 30 years ago.  I would have been the best (cross) dressed person being run out of town.


<blockquote>Was that the right video? Because I’ve seen this guy perform where he produces oodles of bananas to just look at.</blockquote>


That is just to weird to comment on.


<blockquote>I believe that over the long term inflation will ne a problem but over the short term it appears that deflation is a bigger issue.</blockquote>


That's what she said!
