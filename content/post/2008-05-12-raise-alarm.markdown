I spotted this on [http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/grist/daily_grist/~3/285422414/index.html](http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/grist/daily_grist/~3/285422414/index.html)

"Imagine if one out of every three cows, or one out of every three chickens, were dying. That would raise a lot of alarm."

Uh, no it wouldn't, that happens every day.  10 billion animals are killed every year in the US alone... granted, that probably doesn't represent the one out of three statistic, but it should "raise alarm."
