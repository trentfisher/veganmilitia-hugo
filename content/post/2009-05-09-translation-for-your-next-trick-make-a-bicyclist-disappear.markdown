We continue south on 106th Ave NE towards Main Street, and here we are greeted an opportunity to do a magic trick!Â  Make a bicyclist disappear, which is the apparent intent of this bike lane as in gradually narrows into nothingness.

It is too bad the bike shop moved from the storefront on the right, as they were conveniently located to commence repairs on bikes whose riders did not succeed in the vanishing trick, and instead ended up in the lane with the drivers, who, around here, don't tend to notice cyclists until they bounce off their windshield.
