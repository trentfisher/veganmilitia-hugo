Winter here has been brutal, and while it has slackened up quite a bit, I still have a thick blanket of snow (about a foot is my guess).  A couple of weeks ago I started thinking about getting the garden started this year, and got several books both on indoor and outdoor plants.  I also started finding gardening blogs one of the first ones I found, [Your Small Kitchen Garden](http://www.smallkitchengarden.net/), was doing a [seed giveaway](http://www.smallkitchengarden.net/small-kitchen-garden/your-small-kitchen-garden-seed-giveaway-2011), I signed up and forgot about it.  But yesterday I got a letter from an address I didn't recognize and opened it to find this:

So, a big thank you to Daniel for these seeds!  I'm looking forward to getting these started... I've got two new hanging tomato planters that I got last fall (on clearance) and now I know what I'm putting in them.
