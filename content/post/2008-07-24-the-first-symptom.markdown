In a rare display of sanity, the FDA has, for a third time [denied Merck's applications to sell Mevacor over the counter](http://www.naturalnews.com/023695.html).  They noted that  "high cholesterol is a chronic condition lacking overt symptoms, unlike other health problems that are currently treated over the counter."

Actually, there is usually a clear symptom:  that sausage you're shoving down your gullet.  Knock it off and you won't need to pay Merck for dangerous chemicals.

While looking up some things about cholesterol on Wikipedia I found someone complaining that "people have been frightened and badgered into eating a tedious and flavorless diet..."  I think that person is tedious and flavorless.  And, of course, clueless.  My diet has had more flavor since I became vegan.  I actually _learned to cook_, rather than toss a slab of dead animal onto my plate and call it done.
