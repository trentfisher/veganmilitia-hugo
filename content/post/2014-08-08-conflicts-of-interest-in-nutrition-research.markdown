**Conflicts of interest in nutrition research:**  

By Marion  
  



Over the July 4th weekend, a reader sent a link to a paper about to be published in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition titled [_Increased fruit and vegetable intake has no discernible effect on weight loss: a systematic review and meta-analysis._](http://ift.tt/1rNfZRz)




I took a look at the abstract:




<blockquote>Studies to date do not support the proposition that recommendations to increase F/V intake or the home delivery or provision of F/Vs will cause weight loss. On the basis of the current evidence, recommending increased F/V consumption to treat or prevent obesity without explicitly combining this approach with efforts to reduce intake of other energy sources is unwarranted.

> </blockquote>




This would seem to make some sense, no?  But the dismissal of recommendations to increase fruit-and-vegetable consumption sent up red flags.




My immediate question: who paid for this study?




Here’s the conflict of interest statement.

Note the presence of companies making processed foods whose sales would decline if people ate more F&V.




A coincidence?  I don’t think so, alas.




More evidence: just today, Bettina Siegel sent me her [post on a paper](http://ift.tt/1rNfXsE) sponsored by the Corn Refiners Association, once again with a predictable outcome.




When it comes to nutrition research, "guess the sponsor" is a game that is all too easy to win.

  
  

This is why I avoid health arguments about veganism:  little actual science is getting done, and when it does, studies like this quickly pop up
