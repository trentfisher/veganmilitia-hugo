I noted this error, but forgot to note where I got it.  I'm pretty sure it was IBM's support site:

>There is an issue with your login that needs to be addressed before you can successfully login to SR. Please contact the SR help desk.


So I can't log into the SR system due to an "issue", and to get it resolved, I need to file an SR.  My head is spinning, just like the logic.
