[![Bike lane on 116th Ave NE around 7th St.](http://veganmilitia.org/b/wp-content/uploads/2008/10/bk5-300x224.jpg)](http://veganmilitia.org/b/wp-content/uploads/2008/10/bk5.jpg)
116th Ave NE is Bellevue's "auto row", and, ironically, has a nice wide bike lane along the uphill side of an otherwise  rather busy four-lane street (though it only extends about 6 blocks).  But then it is abruptly tapered down to nothing just before the intersection with the unbelievably hostile 8th Street (more on that in future posts).   The red and grey sign on the right is for the local Hummer dealership whose driveway is right where the bike lane ends.  So this is obvious attempt to make me turn right and trade in my bike for an SUV so that I will fit in more amongst the botox and silicone laden, cell-phone wielding, trophy wives in their Lexus SUVs who menace the streets of Bellevue.
