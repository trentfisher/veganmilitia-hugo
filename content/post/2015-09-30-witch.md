Sometime in between 1675 and 1686 [my 8th great grandfather](http://www.werelate.org/wiki/Person:John_Cole_%28157%29) re-married after the death of his first wife (my 8th great grandmother).  [His brother](http://www.werelate.org/wiki/Person:Abraham_Cole_%288%29) married a few years earlier.  Coincidentally, both these women were named Sarah.  Soon, they had something else in common.

In the midst of the Salem Witch Trials, John's wife, [Sarah Alsbee](http://www.werelate.org/wiki/Person:Sarah_Alsbee_%281%29), was accused of witchcraft but was acquitted.  His brother's wife, [Sarah Davis](http://www.werelate.org/wiki/Person:Sarah_Davis_%2889%29) was also accused, and imprisoned, but was released on bail and never brought to trial.

On the other side of the witch trials, my [8th great uncle](http://www.werelate.org/wiki/Person:Isaac_Cummings_%285%29) testified against [Elizabeth Howe](http://www.werelate.org/wiki/Person:Elizabeth_Jackson_%28152%29), claiming that she cursed his horse and set his barn on fire.
