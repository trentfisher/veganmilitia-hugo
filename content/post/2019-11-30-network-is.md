Some of my early career was spent working on Sun workstations and
servers.  Way back then they had the slogan "The Network is the
Computer".  Clearly, that slogan is the old wine in the new bottle
labeled "Cloud", but that's another story.  As I sit looking at an
hourglass or a spinning "progress" icon, I realize that the original
slogan was incomplete, the full version is:

>"The Network is the Computer... and that's why it sucks so bad."

Though, to be fair, the network is not the problem, as such.  The
problem is the way it is used.  Specifically, the apparent pervasive
assumption amongst programmers that all network operations have zero
latency, infinite bandwidth, and are 100% reliable.
