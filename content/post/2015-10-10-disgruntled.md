I happened upon this passage on page 906 of the [Vital Record of Rehoboth](http://ma-vitalrecords.org/MA/Bristol/Rehoboth/Images/Rehoboth_S906.shtml)

> Lett none marvell att the promiscuous and disorderly setting downe of the names of such they are, or may be married, or doe, or may be born, or may dye; for they are sett as they were brought to mee as disorderly as they are sett downe.  If the Courts order had bin minded respecting this matter, they had biue otherwise placed then they are.

The page in question was of records from 1680, clearly some town clerk was frustrated with his job that day.  It's always nice to know that some things are timeless.
