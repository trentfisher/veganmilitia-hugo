I recently upgraded my workstation and, once again, had to change music players.  Though this is just as well since Banshee's 20 seconds of unresponsiveness after changing tracks was pretty intollerable.  So now I tried Clementine.  It seems like a reasonably good player, but on certain tracks I get this:

In my youth I used to think that free software would ultimately be better quality.  So much for that.
