I will do my best to recount my small part amidst the decline of TSR, but many of the original files are gone (or are on media which nobody can read), so the exact dates are a bit fuzzy.

I had been playing AD&D since the early '80 while in high school with two friends, but in total isolation, I rarely met anybody else with interest in it and so our games were pretty much limited to published materials and our own feeble attempts to concoct our own.  In fact, my first DM experience was with Village of Homlett and then I tried to write the sequel promised at the end of that module.  It is probably a good thing that I lost those materials.

Sometime around 1988 I discovered rec.games.frp and related newsgroups on USENET.  This changed everything for me, suddenly I was reading details of other people's games, alternate rules, monsters, maps, stories, etc.  This cross-pollination greatly improved my own game and rejuvenated my interest.

Within a couple of years my university got connected to the internet, and we set up an ftp server on a Tektronix workstation sitting in the computer science lab.  One of the first things I did was start collecting the useful bits from rec.games.frp and populating my ftp site.  On 10-Apr-90 I sent an announcement to rec.games.frp (which is, miraculously, found on Google), and even more things started coming in.

In March of 1994 I took a new job.  A few months later an email was forwarded to me by my successor:

...

At this point in my life I was not really prepared to deal with this:  I had just taken a new job, I was a junior engineer frantically trying to learn new software and how to keep builds and everything else going.  I was also teaching a system administration class at the University, and I was in the process of buying a house and preparing to move.  So this was really the last thing I needed on my plate.
