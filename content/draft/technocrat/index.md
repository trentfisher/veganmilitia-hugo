{{< img-thumb src="card.jpg" alt="one of my Technocracy, Inc. membership cards">}} Some years ago I was chatting with a friend and he made some reference to someone being a "technocrat", and I had to laugh, because for all the times that word is used it is rarely used in the presense of someone who used to be a card-carrying technocrat.  Literally!
 
I have written [previously]({{<relref "2015-03-30-the-lessons-of-technocracy.markdown">}}) about the organization, but, lately, it has come up several times in relation to [Elon Musk's grandfather](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joshua_N._Haldeman), who was involved with the organization before World War II.  And the things said about the organization and their ideas were often a bit skewed, at best, and downright laughable in some cases.  It feels odd to defend an organization I dropped out of decades ago, but here we are.



ouch
