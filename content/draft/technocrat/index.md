 Some years ago I was chatting with a friend and he made some reference to someone being a "technocrat", and I had to laugh, because for all the times that word is used it is rarely used in the presense of someone who used to be a card-carrying technocrat.  Literally! 
 
I have written [previously]({{<relref "2015-03-30-the-lessons-of-technocracy.markdown">}}) about the organization, but, lately, it has come up several times in relation to Elon Musk's grandfather, who was involved with the organization before World War II.
