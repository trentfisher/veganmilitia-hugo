For the early years of my career I worked exclusively with Unix machines, then I took a job in a company which was primarily Windows.  I remember trying to troubleshoot a problem and I was having a hard time.  I told my boss and he asked if the problem would go away upon reboot.  "Yes, most likely".  He told me not to hesitate to tell people to reboot.  This was quite a culture shock.  I had always considered a reboot to be something you only needed when you had to change hardware (and someday we would be able to hot swap components).

Little did I know that was the thin edge of the wedge.
