I haven't been writing about error messages in a while.  But this is not because these horrible error messages are hard to find, but rather I'm overwhelmed by them.  We are all steeped in incomprehensible, unhelpful error messages every day and it just starts to become part of the background noise of our lives.  It's like blogging about drops of water in the river.

So in hopes of getting this going again, here's one of the worst ones I've seen in a long time:

The "details" link is a nice touch, I'm not sure why I didn't capture what happened when I clicked that; I can't remember what is said, but I am certain it was utterly unhelpful.
