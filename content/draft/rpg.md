I was introduced to both computers and Dungeons and Dragons around the same time.  I did not even see a computer until I got to high school, and soon after I could be found in the computer lab after school playing a number of role playing games including
[Temple of Apshai](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temple_of_Apshai),
[Akalabeth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akalabeth:_World_of_Doom), and,
[Ultima II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultima_II:_The_Revenge_of_the_Enchantress).
I got my own computer not long after and was able to spend way too much time playing those games and others including
[Ultima III](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultima_III:_Exodus) and 
[SunDog](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SunDog:_Frozen_Legacy).
Note that I am only mentioning role-playing games.

I also [started playing D&D]({{<relref "2019-09-10-dnd.md">}}) around this time and it was clear that those games all owed a lot to D&D, in fact the basic mechanics of the games all clearly were derived in some ways from D&D mechanics.  The one problem with D&D is that you can only play as often as everyone in the group can play, which was weekly to monthly through the years I played.
The advantage of a computer game is that you can fire it up at any time, and play at your convenience.  As a result I began a long search for the holy grail of an immersive game which could be as fun as D&D.

Once in college, I was introduced to Unix and a number of games including a number of
[roguelike games](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roguelike) like Rogue, Nethack, Omega and a few others I forget.
