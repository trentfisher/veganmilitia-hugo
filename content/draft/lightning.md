Over the last several years I have noticed a common topic which comes up whenever I talk with my father.  He always mentions about how there was another shooting, and how bad the crime is in the city.  After he repeated this enough I began to wonder what was going on.  Whenever I visit, everything seems as good or better than it ever was.  I did a bit of digging and found that the crime rates have been declining for years.

So what is going on here?  Here is my theory:  TV news.  He has been watching more TV news in recent years and the steady drumbeat of stories about crime and tragedy gives the impression of a unfolding disaster.  I have heard it said that the plural of anecdote is not data, but the plural of scary anecdote is fear.

Imagine a TV station which, every night, on the new aired a story about someone who was struck by lightning.  Someone killed!  Next night, a person injured and in the hospital near death.  Next night, a person who was struck years ago and still suffers.  Next night, a person killed when a struck tree exploded.  Next night, a person whose dog was struck in the dog park.  And so on.  Each one accompanied with grisly photographs and footage.  After enough of this many people would be scared to ever go outside.  And that advertisement for a portable Faraday Cage starts to look like a good idea.
