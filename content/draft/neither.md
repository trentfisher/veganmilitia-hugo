When I was in college, the ACM chapter did a survey of students; one of
the questions was what we would call ourselves after graduating:
"software engineer", "programmer", "computer scientist", and probably
a few others I have forgotten.  The majority chose the former, though
I chose the latter.  I don't recall why, but, given my 20 year old mindset,
I probably thought it sounded them more highfalutin.

But now, many years later, I think about this, and I am increasingly
uncomfortable with the term "engineering" to describe what we do.
I have a friend who was a mechanical engineer who designed
towers for high-tension power lines.
Putting what I do in the same category as what he does seems very wrong.
On some level, you can say we are both building things,
but he is building using components with known properties which behave consistently.
On the other hand I am building with numerous components of variable quality

What about scientist.  That seems a bit closer.
Unlike 
in that we are dealing with numerous unknowns
Scientist implies an element of research and
exploring the unknown.  However, as I think about it even more,
that doesn't work either, since it implies methodical

I would therefore like to posit that computing's central challenge, viz. "How not to make a mess of it", has _not_ been met.  On the contrary, most of our systems are much more complicated than can be considered healthy, and are too messy and chaotic to be used in comfort and confidence.  The average customer of the computing industry has been served so poorly that he expects his system to crash all the time, and we witness a massive world-wide distribution of bug-ridden software for which we should be deeply ashamed.
