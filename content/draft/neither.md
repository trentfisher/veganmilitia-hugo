When I was in college the ACM chapter did a survey of students; one of
the questions was what we would call ourselves after graduating:
"software engineer", "programmer", "computer scientist", and probably
a few others I have forgotten.  The majority chose the former, though
I chose the latter.  I may have chosen it as it sounded them most
highfalutin.  Though I always was uncomfortable with the term "engineering"
to describe what I do.  Scientist implies an element of research and
exploring the unknown.  However, as I think about it even more,
that doesn't work either, since it implies

I would therefore like to posit that computing's central challenge, viz. "How not to make a mess of it", has _not_ been met.  On the contrary, most of our systems are much more complicated than can be considered healthy, and are too messy and chaotic to be used in comfort and confidence.  The average customer of the computing industry has been served so poorly that he expects his system to crash all the time, and we witness a massive world-wide distribution of bug-ridden software for which we should be deeply ashamed.
