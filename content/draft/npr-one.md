Almost two years ago I first heard about the NPR One app.  I reluctantly tried it out, and found it incredibly useful and have been using it ever since.  However I'm not here to post a review of NPR One, but use it as a case study of what is wrong with software these days.

So, for over a year NPR One worked very well for me, but recently the reliability has dropped significantly.  I am not sure what caused this, but it might have started when I accidentally left it running (both headphones and phone in my pocket) when I went to get my daughter from the bus.  Afterwards I discovered it had used (wasted) a huge amount of mobile data.  I was unable to find an option to limit it to only work on Wifi, so I went to the app manager and checked the "restrict mobile data" box.

The app then started behaving oddly.  Previously it had been very rare for the app to buffer, at least that's what I assume it was doing, as playback stopped and a spinning icon was on the screen.  This icon has become endemic but is one of the most useless indicators ever.  Over time the frequency of these pauses increased.  At first I could just pause or rewind to get it to resume.  But these workarounds gradually stopped working, to the point that the controls would become completely non functional.  The only control that still worked was the "next show" button.  At first, that would get things going again, and playback would work fine.  For a while.  But as time has gone on, this would happen more and more often.  Sometimes restarting my phone would make it better, but often not.  On top of that the display would not change when it switched shows and the time would just keep adding on, so it might indicate that it is currently playing the NPR Newscast for 179 minutes.  Finally, this morning, I could not get through any show, not even 3 minute news segments.  After a while I had enough, gave up, and I switched to my podcast app and listened to something there.

Now, I am guessing that the issue is on my phone, since the NPR One skill on Alexa seems to work fine.  However this speaks to the general sloppy programming taking place with most apps.
