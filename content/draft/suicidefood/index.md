One of my favorite blogs was [Suicide Food](http://suicidefood.blogspot.com/) which ran from 20-Dec-2006 to 27-Dec-2011, and it documented some of the most horrific examples of [suicide food](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suicide_food).

This is one of those things, that once you are aware of it, you see it everywhere.  I submitted a few photos to that blog back in the day, and I kept accumulating photos after the blog's end.  I tried my hand at making similar posts here (see the [suicide food tagged posts]({{<relref "../tags/suicide-food">}})) but wasn't able to keep that going.  I tried starting up a discussion group on [Lemmy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lemmy_(social_network)) but the instance I was on vanished.

So, I figured I should just collect together all the photos I have saved so far, and continue to accumulate them here.  The quality of these photos vary, as for many of them were taken surreptitiously.  So here they are:
