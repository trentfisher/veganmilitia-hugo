Every decision produces regret.  Sometimes it isn't much or it is quickly forgotten.  But for other decisions the thoughts of what might have been, weighs heavily.  I find that the older I get, the more I think about these things.

My 33rd year was a rather tumultuous year, filled with many decisions which I think back and regret.  That is not to say that I don't like where my life has ended up, but I do wonder what would have happened had I made some different decisions.  One decision in particular weighs on me.  So what follows is an imaginary memoir, a speculation of what might have been, along with many stories of things that did happen, sometimes reformed to fit the narrative, others as a verbatim flashback.

I wake up to the sound of water lapping against the hull and the sun shining in the window above me.  This is my first night of many aboard this little boat.  It bobs on water like a wine cork. Yesterday afternoon my father and I arrived here in Lewiston, and got the boat in the water and then went off for dinner and then he headed back with the trailer, intending to meet be down river.

The boat is a West Wight Potter, a little, and, arguably, ugly, little boat. Only 15 feet long on deck, even less at the waterline.  The hull has these sharp edges to it and large flat panels, reflecting that the original design was built of plywood.

The cabin is just enough room for a V berth, though half of it is full of food, clothes and other necessities, leaving a narrow wedge for my sleeping bag,  My father and I bought it earlier this year.  After the divorce I had no money for such a luxury, but he offered to pay for it.  So we contacted the factory, and ordered one, and planned a road trip to drive to Los Angeles to pick it up and bring it home.

Road trips were a fixture of our lives together for much of my childhood.  I remember waking up at 6am on the couch.  The first day of Christmas vacation from sixth grade.  I jumped up out of "bed".  I was anxious to get on the road, I slept on the couch in my clothes, thinking the slight discomfort would keep me from sleeping through the alarm.  After my customary bowl of Cocoa Puffs, I was ready to go.  We were driving his new company pickup truck to Los Angeles where he had to be for few work meetings, but other than that the next two weeks were ours.  We snacked on peanuts and threw the empty shells on the floor with the empty cans of Mountain Dew.  We took random side roads on a whim, just to see what was there.  I had a stack of AAA maps with which I would navigate us.
