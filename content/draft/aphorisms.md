I was thinking about all the sayings and aphorisms which I use every day and where they came from.  Many I can immediately tell you.  For example, my grandfather, who famously hated driving, when his kids asked if they would drive him somewhere would reply "Walking ain't crowded".


I buy you books and all you do is eat the covers

Hey, stop kicking my dog

Time all dogs are dead, don't you feel sick

I'll turn you inside out and make a Mexican out of you

If you don't have it in your head, you've got it in your feet

Were you born in a barn?
