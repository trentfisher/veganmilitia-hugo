I'm sure you've all heard [the statement from Arthur C. Clark](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clarke%27s_three_laws) that "Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic."

But I had an exchange which convinced me of a variation of that:  "Any suffciently hyped technology is indistinguishable from religion."  The case in point was a discussion with someone who seemed to think that Git was the only version control system which had checkin hooks.  And after informing him that every modern version control system, indeed, every one of them I've used in the last two decades, has such things (in one way or another), he repeated the same thing later on in the conversation, as if unable to process this new piece of information which contradicted established dogma.

I have nothing against Git, and I use it myself.  But my biggest gripe is the religious fervor with which it is hyped, the irrational one-size-fits-all, [Maslow's Hammer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_the_instrument) weilding, 

  Though, to be honest, there have been plenty of religious wars in the software world.  I do use Emacs, after all.


talked about Git as though it was able to do things that no other version control system had ever thought of doing, in particular, checkin hooks!  Checkin hooks have been part of every version control system I've used for the last 20 years.
