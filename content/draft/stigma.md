I have always been curious about the stigma around Dungeons and Dragons

It was the last day of my senior year of high school.  Since seniors
finished school a week earlier than everyone else, my final project in
auto shop had to be evaulated.  My partner and I had done a partial
rebuild of a Vega engine.  Mr. P came over with his handtruck with a
battery, hooked up the jumper cables and tried to start it.  He tried
a number of times until finally a gout of flame jumped several feet
out of the carburetor towards the ceiling.  Mr. P jumped back,
recomposed himself, realigned his ridiculous comb-over, quietly
unhooked the jumper cables, said "you pass" and walked away.  I'm sure
my partner was able to get the engine going in the next week, since he
actually knew what he was doing.  I don't remember much else about the
day, but at the end I walked out the front doors right to my father's
pickup, who was waiting for me.  We immediately started driving south.
I wanted to be as far away from there as I could.  I wanted a clean
break.  By the time the graduation ceremony rolled around I was in Los
Angeles; the cap and gown in my closet would never be worn, and I
would have no further contact with anyone from high school, except...

A few weeks later, I drove to Portland and met up with Lance and Chris to play Dungeons and Dragons.  These were the only friends I stayed in contact
