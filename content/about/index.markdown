The Vegan Militia is a group of six-toed hillbillies who **really** love animals... well, not really.

This blog is the ramblings of a recumbent bike riding leftist abolitionist vegan nerd and all-around weirdo.  This blog is just a place to put my random thoughts, meditations and rants about things of interest to me.  Whether anybody else finds them of interest remains to be seen.

My fossilized web pages can be seen at [http://www.cs.pdx.edu/~trent](http://www.cs.pdx.edu/~trent/)

You can also see [my reading list](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1v61Fkm4171wrBZuY32y-h2ZX_2ldl50AV0ZoK0hrTCE/edit?usp=sharing).

I'm on many other web sites, and I'll eventually add a list or add badges to the sidebar.
