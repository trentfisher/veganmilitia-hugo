[![Bike lane on NE 8th St around 123rd Ave](http://veganmilitia.org/b/wp-content/uploads/2008/10/bk4-300x224.jpg)](http://veganmilitia.org/b/wp-content/uploads/2008/10/bk4.jpg)


NE 8th Street is pretty frightful place to ride, with the worst part being the I-405 overpass which I generally call a "wrongful death lawsuit waiting to happen".  Fortunately for the inevitable victims, Overlake Hospital is right next door.   But once you get to the other side of the freeway there are fragments of bike lane!  One helpfully appears on the westbound side at 120th Ave, right as you begin scaling a steep hill.  But once you get to the top, around 123rd, the bike lane gradually loses about 1 foot of its width, which means you're just a hair's breadth away from the Mercedes SUVs piloted (to use the term very loosely) by the gesticulating, bluetooth enabled maniacs.

Something tells me that with my bike buckets and produce box (see photo), I'm wider than that lane.  Retreat to the sidewalk!
