On Facebook someone posted an article about gardening tasks for March.  I thought that was, at first glance, a cruel joke.  Here's what my garden looks like right now:  [pe2-image src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/-tUOIPBmq02k/VPYQMakTUeI/AAAAAAAAFxk/hWrAZYR8-T4/s144-c-o/0303151022.jpg" href="https://picasaweb.google.com/109920212061848308238/Garden#6122098548932825570" caption="" type="image" alt="0303151022.jpg"]




Nothing is going to happen there for a while!  Of course, I did just get out my soil blockers in preparation for seed starting.  That and dreaming are about the only garden-related things taking place just now.


This is probably the first time I have shared anything about my garden.  I have generally avoided doing so because I feel I am usually fumbling along, making lots of obvious mistakes, and generally not exhibiting the kind of skill I should have.  Perhaps I'm just being hard on myself.  I'll try to share more here, maybe my posts can help one or both of us to learn something, or, if nothing else, it will give you something to laugh at.
