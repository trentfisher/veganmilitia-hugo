This seems to keep happening to me:  I get caught up in a lot of other things in life and never quite get around to my blog. Then after a year or so of inactivity, I suddenly remember it, update the software (now running trunk!) and start posting again.   Let's see how long I can keep it going this time.  I've got a bunch of mostly written drafts in the queue so expect them soon.
