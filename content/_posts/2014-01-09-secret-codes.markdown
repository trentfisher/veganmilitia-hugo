This popup  just came up on my wife's phone:

    
    Alert!
     Sorry, we ran into a problem. Please try again. If the problem persists call us at 800-xxx-xxxx. Error Code 1000.


While it is admirable when engineers make an effort to enumerate all the possible errors a program might get, but to do so without providing further on-screen explanation is just plain mean.  Perhaps they should supply a secret decoder ring for those who don't simply want to stare confusedly at the screen and retry the operation under the assumption that the unspecified "problem" will simply go away.
