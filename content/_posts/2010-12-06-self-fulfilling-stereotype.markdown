I'm sitting in a doctor's waiting room looking at a diet/nutrition magazine, which really seems to be a "how much meat and cheese can we squeeze in and still be healthy" sort of magazine.  I just ran into the "special diets bookshelf" section and see a vegan cookbook listed.  The reviewer says


<blockquote>... with dozens of recipes each proving that "lactose free," "ethical" and "environmentally sustainable" are not synonymous with boring or difficult.</blockquote>


If readers weren't thinking that being a vegan was boring or difficult before they read that, they are now.  Everyone knows that doing ethical or environmentally sustainable things must always take a back seat to taste.  However, if a chef cannot make an interesting or flavorful vegan dish, they are _incompetent_.  Any moron can throw a slab of flesh onto a plate and and have a flavorful meal.  Many do.
