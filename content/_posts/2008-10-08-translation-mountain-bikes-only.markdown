[![bike lane at SE 8th and 118th Ave SE, Bellevue, WA](http://veganmilitia.org/b/wp-content/uploads/2008/10/bk1.jpg)](http://veganmilitia.org/b/wp-content/uploads/2008/10/bk1.jpg)


If you look at the Bellevue bike map, you'll see 118th Ave marked as a bike route (the map does not distinguish bike lanes from bike routes as it would show how few of the former exist).  After leaving downtown 118th Ave does have a couple miles of bike lanes.  But at the intersection with SE 8th Street bicyclists are apparently expected to jump over the curb extensions on both sides of this intersection.  So, mountain bikers will get a bit of jumping practice, but those of us on road bikes or recumbents are left in a position where we will undoubtedly have to stop and wait for traffic to clear, and, if the light is still green, proceed.  A harsh reminder to bicyclists of their second-class status in the eyes of car drivers and road designers.
