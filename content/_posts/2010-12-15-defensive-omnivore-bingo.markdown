A while back I happened upon a "defensive omnivore bingo" card at [veganporn](http://www.veganporn.com/1052300484/Defensive-Omnivore-Bingo), I then found the [original](http://www.postpunkkitchen.com/forum/viewtopic.php?pid=2053258#p2053087), a [revised version](http://www.easyvegan.info/2009/12/15/defensive-omnivore-bingo-2/), a [more artistic version](http://www.messyvegetariancook.com/2010/03/12/five-ridiculous-things-people-say-to-vegans/), a [feminist version](http://www.easyvegan.info/2009/12/16/anti-feminist-vegetarian-bingo/), and many reposts.

As an exercise for learning Jquery, I wrote a [javascript enabled version](http://www.veganmilitia.org/bingo/) which picks random statements from a long list including ones from the versions above and some of my own. I started to add answers to some of the statements in popups.  You can even place chips on the squares (by clicking), but the "bingo" is entirely anti-climactic. Â I actually started writing this months ago, but I just worked out a couple of annoying bugs. Feel free to send me any suggestions for additional statements and/or answers.
