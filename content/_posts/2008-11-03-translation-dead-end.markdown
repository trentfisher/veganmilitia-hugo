[![](http://veganmilitia.org/b/wp-content/uploads/2008/10/dscn0981s-293x300.jpg)](http://veganmilitia.org/b/wp-content/uploads/2008/10/dscn0981s.jpg)While riding down 114th Ave NE, near SE 2nd St, I spotted this amusing juxtaposition.  Just in case you can't tell from my terrible photography, there is a sign helpfully indicating that the bike route for the Lake Washington Loop is straight ahead.  But from this angle, directly ahead of that sign is a "dead end" sign.  Maybe this is a different definition of "loop" than I am accustomed to.

But the bike route actually does go down that road, which is only a dead end for cars, a short bike path connects the end of that street with 112th Ave right before the nightmare of 8th Street (more on that later).

However, in a city that considered bicycles real vehicles, there would be a sign below "dead end" which said "except bicycles."
