Here we are at 118th Ave SE, approaching SE 8th Street.  The "motorcycles" warning sign wasn't there last time I rode through here, otherwise you could more easily see the irony here.  The small sign is a route marker for the Lake Washington Loop bike route, which helpfully indicates that the route is straight ahead.  Of course the temporary warning sign is not just blocking the bike lane, but also obscuring the fact that it narrows down to nothing.  Nothing says "bike route" like vanishing bike lanes.
