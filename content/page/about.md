The Vegan Militia is a group of six-toed hillbillies who love animals in ways not permitted in 46 states... well, not really.

This blog is the ramblings of a recumbent bike riding leftist abolitionist vegan nerd and all-around weirdo.  This blog is just a place to put my random thoughts, meditations and rants about things of interest to me.  Whether anybody else finds them of interest remains to be seen.

My fossilized web pages can be seen at [http://www.cs.pdx.edu/~trent](http://www.cs.pdx.edu/~trent/)

Here are some other places you can find me:

* [GitHub](https://github.com/trentfisher)
* [Mastodon](https://dice.camp/@trent)
* [StartPlaying](https://startplaying.games/gm/trent)
* [my reading list](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1v61Fkm4171wrBZuY32y-h2ZX_2ldl50AV0ZoK0hrTCE/edit?usp=sharing).
* Twitter -- I abandoned it because I am neither a nazi or techbro sycophant.
* Facebook -- Abandoned it as I don't like hanging out with toxic people on a toxic platform enriching a toxic billionaire.
* Reddit -- Abandonded it... I hope you are sensing a theme.
